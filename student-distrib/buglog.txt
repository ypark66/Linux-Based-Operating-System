/***** MP3.1 *****/
BUG:	Double-fault error
	DESC: Upon running the kernel for part 1, the kernel would always throw a double-fault exception rather than cycling.
DEV:	Tyler Davis (tylerjd2)
DATE:	March 9, 2019
FIX:	So it TURNS OUT that FIRST we weren't including the initialization of the PIC, which caused strange interrupt behavior and a
	double fault. THEN we included it and got a General Protection Exception. THEN we found out we were initializing the PIC incorrectly
	by writing all 4 command words to the COMMAND port instead of the data PORT. Approx. 6 hours of work on this one.

DEV:	Tyler Davis (tylerjd2)
DATE:	April 6, 2019
FIX:	When reading the arguments from the command parameter, there was no check for
		a NULL character. Therefore, the check would just fail and execute would 
		harmlessly return.
		
BUG:	Execute causes a PAGE FAULT.
	DESC: Execute reaches the point where it jumps to user code but then PAGE FAULTs.
DEV:	Tyler Davis (tylerjd2)
DATE:	April 6, 2019
FIX:	The IRET context for execute was in the wrong order, so the code was trying
		to use a non-address as an address.
	
BUG:	Execute generates GENERAL PROTECTION EXCEPTION.
	DESC: Execute will run, but then generate a GENERAL PROTECTION EXCEPTION.
DEV:	Tyler Davis (tylerjd2)
DATE:	April 6, 2019
FIX:	Amongst other things, the IDT entry was not properly set, and the context 
		switch happened out of order. Solid 3 hours on this one :(.
		
BUG:	System Call linkage fails.
	DESC: The system call linkage is calling the wrong function.
DEV:	Tyler Davis (tylerjd2)

BUG:	PAGE FAULT on running fish.
	DESC: 	Fish always causes a page fault/boot loop when halting because it tries

DEV:	Tyler Davis (tylerjd2)
DATE:	April 29, 2019
FIX:	The file buffer for the fish program was colliding with its PCB and exceeding its
		page limit. We got rid of the file buffer and replaced it with a straight memcpy
		to avoid the collision.
